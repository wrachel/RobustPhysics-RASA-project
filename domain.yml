  utter_iamabot:
    - text: "I am a bot, powered by Rasa."

  utter_explain_frequency_vector:
    - text: "To create a frequency vector, go under the Tree solution domain node and add the frequency vector."

  utter_explain_frequency_sample:
    - text: "Set the frequency sample for solving the model in the window below the Tree solution domain node."

  utter_explain_input_spectral_data:
    - text: "To input spectral data, store frequency-dependent input data like Permittivity and Conductivity in the model database called 'Spectral Data'."

  utter_explain_add_spectral_data_dialog:
    - text: "To add spectral data, right-click and select 'add' to open a dialog box for entering the necessary information."

  utter_explain_copy_paste_spectral_data:
    - text: "You can manually enter Spectral Data in the provided grids or copy & paste it from a spreadsheet."

  utter_model_tree_spectral_data:
    - text: "To model tree data for an antenna power input, you can follow these steps: In Model Tree/Spectral Data, enter S11. Then, in Model Tree / Power, define a Power (W) spectrum. Finally, in Model Tree / Antenna, define the antenna name and S11."

  utter_add_tx_power_input:
    - text: "To add Tx power input, you can follow these steps: In Tree / Table view, go to Excitation / Power Inputs, right-click the field, and click edit. If you're in the 3D Model Window, select the cavit wavefield and click the power source button in the toolbar."

  utter_edit_tx_power_inputs:
    - text: "To edit Tx power inputs, go to the power inputs dialog, add multiple Tx sources, define the antenna & power spectrum for each, and define the location of the antenna in 3D. This defaults to the center of the cavity."

  utter_locate_tx_power_inputs_3d:
    - text: "To locate the Tx power inputs in 3D geometry, right-click on the 3D power input object -> Edit excitation. You can edit, move, delete it, etc."

  utter_edit_component:
    - text: "To edit a component, right-click the component you'd like to edit, and click the 'edit' option."

  utter_delete_component:
    - text: "To delete a component, right-click the component you'd like to delete, and click the 'delete' option."
