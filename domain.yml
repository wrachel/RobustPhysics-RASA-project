  utter_explain_frequency_vector:
    - text: "To create a frequency vector, go under the Tree solution domain node and add the frequency vector."

  utter_explain_frequency_sample:
    - text: "Set the frequency sample for solving the model in the window below the Tree solution domain node."

  utter_explain_input_spectral_data:
    - text: "To input spectral data, store frequency-dependent input data like Permittivity and Conductivity in the model database called 'Spectral Data'."

  utter_explain_add_spectral_data_dialog:
    - text: "To add spectral data, right-click and select 'add' to open a dialog box for entering the necessary information."

  utter_explain_copy_paste_spectral_data:
    - text: "You can manually enter Spectral Data in the provided grids or copy & paste it from a spreadsheet."

  utter_explain_external_efield_constraints:
    - text: "In model tree/spectral data, define an Electric Field (V/m) spectrum. In Tree/Table view Excitation/Constraint/Wavefield, 
    right click edit. In 3D model view, select cavity wavefield and click constraint source button in Toolbar. Finally, right click and edit
    the Add Constraint dialog to define E-field spectrum level."

  utter_explain_max_min_field_limits:
   - text: "Select solver setting from Menu Bar. In Dialog, define the Probability Percentiles that you would like model to use to calculate
   Max and Min E-field levels in each cavity wavefield. At Menu Bar/Solve, select "Solve Cavity Model". Wait for "Calculation complete" 
   or "Error message" to be displayed."

  utter_explain_efield_outputs:
  - text: "Outputs specral data are shown under Outputs node. Tile Windows (Plots) can be viewed by using Menu Bar/Windows/Tile option
  to display all open plots. Finally, in the Plot dialog, click the "Table" tab to access the Graphed Outputs in tabular data form.
  "Copy and Paste to spreadsheet for reports, post-processing, etc."
