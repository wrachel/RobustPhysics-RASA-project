utter_respond_quadrature_requirements_explanation:
- text: "Quadrature requires the network to be solved with sources placed at multiple interior points on the line. The segment containing the source does not need to be split at the point of the voltage source. The voltage source at position x = x_l is translated to become voltage and current sources at x = L. The quadrature formula then becomes P_d,n = 1/2 Σ_(l = 1)^(L) (w_l * L_n [V_E(L-x_l), L])."
