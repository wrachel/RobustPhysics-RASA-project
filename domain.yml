    - text: "We present an algorithm to calculate the per-unit-length (PUL) properties of cable harnesses with some cables inside shields. The algorithm mainly solves three problems: 1. The capacitance, inductance, and conductance matrices are calculated from FreeFEM simulations. Shields cut the whole simulation area into several disconnected domains. We have to run FreeFem several times on the connected domains inside or outside shields, then combine the results from multiple FreeFem simulations. 2. A shield is described by its transfer impedance. The algorithm integrates the transfer impedance into PUL properties. 3. An approximation method is developed to estimate the PUL radiation impedance."

It can be found from a finite length of line that is terminated with a matched load and driven with a matched source, determining the total energy radiated."

  utter_respond_direct_approach_radiation_resistance:
    - text: "The direct approach to finding the radiation resistance of a transmission line involves calculating the radiated field from the current on the line and integrating it over the sphere. This approach requires accurate modeling of the radiated field."

  utter_answer_statistical_power_balance_method:
    - text: "Lyon introduced the statistical power balance method in 1962 for predicting the vibration and acoustic response of multiply connected reverberant subsystems within the framework of statistical energy analysis (SEA)."

  utter_answer_SEA_framework:
    - text: "Statistical energy analysis (SEA) is a framework introduced by Lyon in 1962. Hill has laid the foundations for statistical power balance modeling of EM fields in reverberant, multi-modal domains within this framework."

  utter_answer_deterministic_models_vs_statistical_reduction:
    - text: "Deterministic models, while an alternative approach, do not reliably estimate the predicted EM field at a specific point and frequency without statistical reduction to account for uncertainties in the EM source field and parameters of the reverberant domain."

  utter_answer_modal_expansion_basis:
    - text: "Bremner has shown how a modal expansion basis for each reverberant EM field can be used to predict the first two statistical moments of the response - mean and variance - from the physical EM parameters of each subsystem. It involves selecting a suitable probability density function to predict both mean and maximum expected response in each domain."

  utter_answer_application_of_statistical_power_balance_approach:
    - text: "Hill's statistical power balance approach has been applied to a general network of reverberant electromagnetic subsystems, including modeling EM environments in connected cavities typical of a space launch vehicle payload fairing. Junqua's approach, applied in this context, yielded encouraging results for the statistical mean electric field in each subsystem, beneficial for space vehicle EMC design."

  utter_answer_Inverse_Gamma_distribution:
    - text: "Bremner recently proposed an Inverse Gamma distribution for the frequency variance of the field energy, offering advantages over the heuristic assumption of a Log Normal distribution. Treating Rayleigh statistics as conditional on this frequency variance results in a non-parametric PDF for the frequency-stirred electric field, valid for a wide range of cavity Q factors."

  utter_answer_E_field_PDF:
    - text: "The new E field PDF proposed by Bremner is calculated from the predictable mean and variance of the energy. It is shown to be valid for a wide range of cavity Q factors and offers a consistent manner of predicting the electric field at any discrete frequency within a given band, applicable to both under-moded and over-moded cavities."
  utter_answer_energy_subsystem_in_SPB_modelling:
    - text: "In statistical power balance (SPB) modeling, an energy subsystem refers to a group of resonant modes with a locally unique reverberant energy level. Variations in reverberant energy levels among connected cavity fields occur due to differences in field excitations in each cavity or significant variations in cavity Q, often caused by localized loss mechanisms such as RF absorbing materials or aperture leakage."
  utter_answer_total_energy_in_cavity:
    - text: "The total energy of the reverberant field in a cavity with volume V is equal to the product of its energy density averaged over space, indicated by <>, and its volume. Alternatively, it can be expressed as E = ½(εE^2 + μH^2)V, where ε, μ, E, and H are, respectively, the permittivity, permeability, total electric, and total magnetic fields at any location in the cavity. E is the field magnitude at a location. E^2 and H^2 are mean-squared electric and magnetic fields which are related through Z, where Z is the characteristic impedance of the medium. The total energy E is constant with time, but energy oscillates between electric field energy and magnetic field energy over time. When considering only the electric field energy, E = ½(εE^2)V, we have the additional ½ factor due to time averaging. However, the total constant energy is more important in this context."
  utter_answer_average_modal_density:
    - text: "Hill has shown that the average electromagnetic modal density of an enclosed volume is relatively insensitive to geometric details and can be calculated at any given frequency from only the electromagnetic wave speed and the volume of the enclosure."
  utter_answer_power_balance_principle:
    - text: "For any cavity reverberant field, the power balance principle requires that the power input from an external source (e.g., antenna) must be balanced by the total power dissipated by all losses, where Q is the cavity Q factor (Δf is the corresponding damping loss factor)."
  utter_answer_statistical_power_balance_modeling:
    - text: "Previous work on statistical power balance modeling used δ as the quantity describing energy dissipation in each cavity reverberant field and coupling cross section to describe energy exchange between two reverberant fields between cavities i and j, where δ indicates an average over all angles Ω and polarizations of the field. In this model, Lyon's dimensionless loss factor notation is preferred, denoted by η for the damping loss factor of cavity i and κ for coupling loss factors between cavities i and j."
  utter_answer_power_balance_model:
    - text: "In the power balance model, each cavity's damping loss factor includes wall losses, absorption cross sections (surface absorption losses), and antenna loading losses (effective antenna losses). It's important to note that, contrary to Hill's power balance modeling of reverberation chambers, neither the open aperture loss nor any leakage loss are included in each cavity's damping loss factor. This omission is because energy exchange through any aperture is modeled explicitly by a coupling loss factor. The net energy exchange across any aperture or leak depends on the difference in modal energy levels of the reverberant wavefields on each side, which can only be defined by the energy equilibrium solution of the power balance matrix (Eq. Ref 7)."
  utter_answer_absorption_coefficient:
    - text: "The absorption coefficient is defined as the integral of the absorption cross section over the surface area of the material. It represents the fraction of incident electromagnetic energy absorbed by the material. The average damping loss factor due to absorption for a cavity, along with its corresponding Q factor, is defined in reference literature. The Reflection Loss for RF absorbing materials is typically measured and published by the manufacturer and stored as spectral data in the model's cavity damping database. Alternatively, the surface absorption of a specific surface area inside a cavity may be defined by the 'absorption section.' In practical applications, such as reverberant field cavities containing electronics, losses from absorption of constituent materials and losses due to printed circuit board traces terminating in matched impedances are accounted for. Complex materials and assemblies within the cavity, such as a spacecraft with an array of electronics, typically have losses quantified as an absorption cross section. Recent measurements by Flintoft et al for an ensemble of different printed circuit board architectures show that surface absorption losses are generally greater than 'effective antenna' losses."
  utter_answer_coupling_loss_factor:
    - text: "The coupling loss factor consists of the coupling through apertures. Unlike Lyon's statistical energy analysis (SEA) coupling loss factors, which are less common in electromagnetics, aperture cross section is more widely used to describe the power transmission characteristic of the aperture. The power transmission coefficient (PTC) is defined as the ratio of power incident on the aperture from a source wavefield with reverberant energy E_r to the power transmitted to free field (i.e., reverberant energy level E_t). For an aperture in an enclosure surface, the average PTC over steradians and over all polarities of incident wave is denoted. By definition, the corresponding transmission cross section of the aperture (with units of area) is simply the average PTC multiplied by the area of the aperture. The aperture coupling loss factor is defined as the power transmitted to free field in the receiving space (E_t) for a given reverberant energy level in the source field (E_r). Therefore, the coupling loss factor is always defined for free field conditions in the receiving field (E_t) because it is an influence coefficient in the power balance matrix. Coupling loss factors defined in this way satisfy the reciprocity relationship."
  utter_answer_layered_materials:
    - text: "In high-frequency electromagnetic field engineering, two-dimensional panels or sheets of layered materials can play important roles. The laminate may consist of multiple layers, each with quite different materials or constructions, including dielectric materials (e.g., RF absorber, insulator, air, etc.), solid conducting materials (e.g., metals), perforates and screens, and other periodic constructions (e.g., frequency-selective surfaces). Each layer is assumed to have a finite (non-zero) thickness that is small compared to the transverse length and width dimensions of the laminate panel, and not much thicker than the wavelength of electromagnetic propagation in each layer material. Under these conditions, laminated sheets reflect, transmit, and absorb incident electromagnetic waves from a reverberant cavity field, but do not themselves support any strong build-up of local reverberant energy. As a result, they are represented in the statistical power balance (SPB) model as cavity wall loss factors and/or as energy transmission coupling loss factor(s) between reverberant electric fields."
  utter_answer_transfer_matrix_method:
    - text: "The surface reflection coefficient of a multi-layer laminate, required to calculate the wall loss factor, and the transmission coefficient of a multi-layer laminate, required to calculate the coupling loss factor, can be calculated using the transfer matrix method. The reflection coefficient is calculated as a function of incident wave angle and for two orthogonal polarities – transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM). These results are then averaged to provide the following 'macro' properties for the multi-layer laminate: Reflection Loss and Insertion Loss. For reverberant EM field modeling, the required averaging may be application-specific, and the user should have the option to specify normal incidence, random incidence, or field incidence, as well as TE, TM, or both polarities."

  utter_answer_stochastic_wave_mechanics:
    - text: "The definition of an electromagnetic (EM) field response as an energy level allows the use of stochastic wave mechanics to define the modal properties and response of arbitrarily complex cavity fields. Stochastic wave mechanics models are stochastic in the sense that a larger ensemble of resonant modes in a subsystem – and a larger number of statistically independent subsystems in a total system model – leads to a more reliable, converged result. In statistical models, a converged prediction is one in which the relative variance of uncertainty on the prediction approaches zero, meaning the standard deviation of the uncertainty is very small compared to the predicted mean. In the context of Statistical Power Balance (SPB), the modal parameters of complex cavity fields are considered to be a statistical ensemble due to inherent uncertainty in the 'as-built' dimensions, boundary conditions, etc., and uncertainty in the 'as-operated' mass distribution, material properties, damping, etc., in addition to any uncertainty associated with random loading. These uncertainties are significant in any dynamic system at higher frequencies, and studies have shown that the as-built variability (uncertainty) is significant above only the first 5-10 resonant modes."
  utter_answer_frequency_stirred_probability_distribution:
    - text: "It is clear from Figure 9 that there is a stronger variance with frequency than would be typical of an over-moded reverberation chamber. As a result, the 'frequency-stirred' probability distribution differs significantly from the exponential distribution (Chi-squared with 2 degrees of freedom) used in reverberation chambers. Following the work of Lyon and Langley, Bremner used an asymptotic statistical reduction of the modal expansion for electric field in a cavity to confirm that the Chi-squared distribution at a single frequency is conditional on the spatial mean electric field. From Bayesian statistics, the unconditional electric field Probability Density Function (PDF) at any spatial point and frequency (rad/s) can be defined from the product of the conditional Chi-square distribution and the marginal distribution of the spatial mean electric field. The mean field in each cavity is directly proportional to the total energy, where E_total is a component of the total electric field. The mean energy level for k multiply-connected cavities can be readily predicted from the statistical power balance matrix. The unconditional electric field PDF can therefore be written in terms of the marginal PDF of the field energy level. Weaver has derived a non-parametric relative variance formulation for the energy of a reverberant wave field based on modal overlap m of the cavity’s input Conductance, where L and N are respectively the number of receiver and source positions used to calculate cavity energy. Modal overlap is defined as the ratio of the modal damping bandwidth to the frequency spacing. The parameter K is the measure of the spatial variance of the cavity mode shapes, which asymptotes to a value close to 3. Langley & Cotoni have provided a matrix formulation for propagating this relative variance for any network of multiply connected reverberant fields."
  utter_answer_energy_probability_distribution:
    - text: "There is not wide agreement on the probability distribution of energy. Researchers have proposed various distributions including Gamma, Log-Normal, and Complex Wishart distributions. Bremner has shown that energy is proportional to the sum of mean-squared electric field levels over the enclosure volume, represented as a sum over N samples. Similar to the total mean-squared electric field being Chi Square distributed with 6 degrees of freedom, the energy should be Chi Square distributed with 6N degrees of freedom. Lyon’s original 1969 paper suggested a Gamma distribution, which has a k parameter to represent the 6N degrees of freedom. However, the Gamma distribution is not a good fit for under-moded fields. The Inverse Gamma distribution has been found to be more suitable, taking the form shown. On a log scale, the inverse gamma distribution is approximately symmetrically banded for all. The relative variance increases asymptotically above unity at small values."
  utter_answer_unconditional_electric_field_PDF:
    - text: "A closed form solution for the unconditional electric field Probability Density Function (PDF) is possible if the marginal energy PDF is assumed to be an Inverse Gamma distribution, which is integrable. In this case, the probability density function for electric field level at any spatial point is a new distribution, as shown in the equation provided. The parameters alpha and beta can be calculated from the mean energy and the frequency variance of the energy for each cavity electric field. The parameter alpha is defined by the relative variance of the mean squared electric field, which is equivalent to the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) relative variance of energy. And the parameter beta is defined by alpha and the power balance equation for mean energy."
  utter_answer_lossy_cavities:
    - text: "In lossy cavities, the reverberant field is attenuated by the absorber materials, so the direct field from the source antenna and aperture power inputs to the cavity reverberant field cannot be ignored. The direct field amplitude at any location depends on the distance from the source due to spherical spreading of the radiated power. A direct field is always present for each source driving a reverberant field, and the total field is the uncorrelated sum of the direct and reverberant fields. The direct field is calculated independently for each effective power input, which can usually be assumed to be statistically uncorrelated. Hill has shown that the total field will have a Rice distribution, as described in the equation provided. The measured spatial field distribution shown in [25] indicates that in the Bare condition, the reverberant field dominates the direct field, and the spatial gradient of the field is determined by statistical power balance with a Chi-squared Probability Density Function (PDF). When one-inch-thick RF absorbing foam is added to the cavity walls, the reverberant field is attenuated to less than the direct field, and the total measured field approaches the spatial distribution of an ideal direct field. The top of the cavity (z>150cm) is always reverberant since there is no RF foam on the walls above 150 cm, and the parabolic shape results in strong field reflection and scattering."
  utter_answer_hybrid_model_solution:
    - text: "The 'hybrid' deterministic-statistical coupling model is solved in a three-step process. The first step involves cable transmission line modeling with deterministic terminal voltage (and/or current) sources and direct field radiation losses to a source-free and boundary-free exterior field. The second step is the cavity stochastic power balance modeling to predict the reverberant electric field in each cavity due to power sources independent of the cable harness and due to the combination of cable radiation power inputs and cable radiation loading. The third step involves the stochastic modeling of the total cable harness currents and terminal voltages, comprising two components: the (uncoupled) direct field currents and voltages under deterministic terminal loads obtained from Step 1, and the additional reverberant cable currents and voltages under the stochastic excitation by coupled cavity electric fields obtained from Step II. The mean-squared current in a conductor is proportional to the expected value of the squared magnetic field, which can be predicted from the cavity reverberant energy level using the principle of diffuse field reciprocity and from the applied terminal voltages, which are proportional to the expected value of terminal electric fields. Here, m is the modal overlap of the cavity, Z_rad is the free field radiation impedance of the conductor in the cable harness, and Z_line is the total line impedance of the conductor (including conductivity). Both line impedances are obtained from the deterministic Transmission Line model of the cable harness."
  utter_answer_RhoPhy_data_structure_definition:
    - text: "The RhoPhy Data Structure is used to define the list of cable segments in each cavity wavefield. It includes information about the uncoupled cable analysis, which calculates the total power radiated to free field for the group of cable segments within each cavity field. The radiation impedance is defined on a cable harness so that the radiation from the cable harness is modeled as the Ohmic loss consumed by the radiation impedance. To find radiation into the cavity, sources are placed on ports and the system is solved. Power dissipated in lumped radiation impedances and PUL radiation impedances gives the power radiated into the cavity. Power in individual impedance terms can be added since interference was taken care of in the radiation impedance calculation. Under the common mode (CM) radiation assumption, the total power radiated to free field by the group of cable segments that lie within a cavity is the summation over power contributions from each individual conductor (wire). The vector of radiated power losses from all of the cable segments within each cavity wavefield is then written to the RhoPhy Model Data Structure."
  utter_answer_conductor_radiated_power:
    - text: "The radiated power from the lumped radiation impedance in a conductor is determined by the current network solver, which outputs the current and voltage on both ends of the conductor. The conductor, represented by a cable segment, has lumped radiation and non-radiation impedance on both sides. The radiated power from the lumped radiation impedance can be calculated based on the current and voltage outputs from the solver. This process involves considering the conductor's properties and the impedance characteristics of the surrounding environment. By analyzing the current and voltage data, the radiated power from the lumped radiation impedance can be accurately determined."
  utter_answer_diffuse_field_modeling:
    - text: "An ideally diffuse field within a cavity is modeled as a superposition of uniform plane waves. Each plane wave in the expansion excites the propagating modes on the line. The excitation by a plane wave is modeled as a set of current and voltage sources at the termination of the line. The local reference of the line is aligned on the z-axis, allowing the excitation source model of Paul (2008) to be used. The plane wave incidence angle and polarization vectors are rotated to account for differences between the local (z-aligned) and physical coordinates. A plane wave in the local coordinate system can be represented by an arbitrary polarization vector, the free-space wavenumber, and elevation and azimuth angles from which the wave is incident. With this excitation, induced voltage and currents on the MTL segment can be calculated. When the MTL reference conductor is a wire, the voltage source vector is determined using specific equations. Similarly, when the reference conductor is a ground plane in the x = 0 plane (in local coordinates), the voltage source vector is calculated differently. It's important to note that this voltage source vector is only used internally to the OSU Comp. Mod. II transmission Line code and does not need to be written to the RhoPhy data structure."
  utter_answer_cavity_loss_factor_calculation:
    - text: "To calculate the cavity loss factor due to radiation loading, the field excitation is applied with any nominal value, such as unity. The radiation resistance is used to find the loading that an MTL segment within a network places on a particular cavity. The segment exposed to the diffuse field acts as a receiving antenna with a radiation resistance, and an equivalent voltage source that accounts for the excitation by the external field is found. The mean power delivered to a matched load placed on the output of an antenna in an ideal diffuse field can be calculated using a specific equation. An equivalent circuit model is then used to deliver the mean-square power to the matched load. The appropriate 'diffuse' voltage source is determined and added to the line, and the power dissipated by the network loads is summed. The power 'dissipated' in the load should not be included since that power is radiated back into the cavity field. The quality factor due to the network loading is found using another equation involving cavity volume, angular frequency, and mean energy density in the diffuse field."
  utter_answer_voltage_source_distribution:
    - text: "The voltage source due to a diffuse field ideally should be distributed across the line segment, similar to the distribution of the radiation resistance along the line. However, because the source is incoherent, the contributions of the differential voltage sources on the line must be added incoherently. The distributed voltage source on the line, represented by Q(x), is calculated using an integration formula evaluated using Gaussian quadrature. The network solution that gives the power dissipated in the nth network load when a voltage source of magnitude V(x) is placed at position x on the line can be determined using this approach. The quadrature requires the network to be solved with sources placed at multiple interior points on the line. Translation matrices are used to translate the voltage source at position x to become voltage and current sources at specific points. The network must be solved L times using the quadrature approach, but the network is only set up once so no matrix inversions are required in the solution stage, minimizing the computational cost. Finally, the vector of Cable Segment Loading Q factors should be written to the RhoPhy Model Data Structure, referencing appropriate Spectral Data objects for spectral data and damping loss factor."
  utter_answer_total_power_dissipation:
    - text: "The total power dissipated by all losses is equal to the fraction of power loss, denoted as alpha, times the field energy level occurring at rate omega (rad/s). The Q factor, which is the inverse of the loss factor, is a key parameter in determining the total cavity wavefield loss factor. This factor accounts for contributions from multiple different loss mechanisms, including those defined in the Math Spec I [Uncoupled] Cavity Wavefields Analysis. Additionally, in coupled cable-cavity analysis, each cable segment behaves like an antenna, contributing an additional loss mechanism to each cavity wavefield that contains one or more cable segments."

There is no closed form solution for the Quantiles of the Rice distribution, so they have to be iteratively calculated from the Rice Cumulative distribution using the Marcum Q function of order 1. For user-defined probabilities, the corresponding Max XT and Min XT are simple roots of the monotonically increasing Rice Cumulative distribution."
