  utter_explain_frequency_vector:
    - text: "To create a frequency vector, go under the Tree solution domain node and add the frequency vector."

  utter_explain_frequency_sample:
    - text: "Set the frequency sample for solving the model in the window below the Tree solution domain node."

  utter_explain_input_spectral_data:
    - text: "To input spectral data, store frequency-dependent input data like Permittivity and Conductivity in the model database called 'Spectral Data'."

  utter_explain_add_spectral_data_dialog:
    - text: "To add spectral data, right-click and select 'add' to open a dialog box for entering the necessary information."

  utter_explain_copy_paste_spectral_data:
    - text: "You can manually enter Spectral Data in the provided grids or copy & paste it from a spreadsheet."
  utter_create_cylindrical_fairing_volume:
  - text: "To create a cylindrical fairing volume, click on the “Add Cylinder” button, specify the height, radius, and position data, then hit Save."
  utter_create_spacecraft_volume:
  - text: "Select a spacecraft volume from the Toolbar Click on the “Add [3D solid selected]” button, specify the dimensions and position data, then hit Save."
  utter_cut_shape:
  - text: "To cut a shape:\n\nSelect a shape either in the 3D window (or in the Model tab)\n\nUsing Ctrl + click, select a second shape.\n\nHit the Toolbar CUT button to perform the cut.\n\n\nNote: The second shape will always cut the first shape. Both shapes must be intersecting for this to work. This functionality works with other cut shapes and combined shapes as well."
  utter_add_ellipsoid:
  - text: "To add an ellipsoid, click on the “Add Ellipsoid” button, specify the 3 radii and position data, then hit Save.\n\nEdit Height (e.g., above Cylinder) in 3D Location tab."
  utter_add_sphere:
  - text: "To add a sphere, click on the “Add Sphere” button, specify the radius and position data, then hit Save."
  utter_ask_tree_view:
    - text: "Tree view on the left of the main window shows all the input and output data to the software. When the program starts, it is empty by default."

  utter_pan_model:
    - text: "Use keyboard arrows or mouse wheel to pan the model."

  utter_scroll_in_out:
    - text: "Scroll your mouse to zoom in or out."

  utter_rotate_model:
    - text: "Click the right mouse button and move to rotate."

  utter_hide_objects:
    - text: "In “MODEL tab” click to select a Model Object & hit SPACEBAR to toggle VISIBILITY ON / OFF."

  utter_add_3d_geometry:
    - text: "Can be done either via the Tree View under Geometry → Exterior Field or the 3D Model window tool palette."

  utter_wire_constructions:
    - text: "Wire constructions found under 1D Cable Current Fields → Wires Sections in the Tree / Table view. Wires have the following properties (all units in meters): Conductor material & diameter + Insulation material & thickness."

  utter_add_connectors:
    - text: "Can be added via the Tree view under Wire Junctions → Connectors or directly within the 3D Model Window via the Tool Palette."

  utter_create_junction:
    - text: "To automatically create a “Junction” at intersections of Cavities and Geometries, select the “Cavity Intersect” Button. This will create junctions at all points where a cable crosses a face of a cavity or geometry."
