  utter_answer_statistical_power_balance_method:
    - text: "Lyon introduced the statistical power balance method in 1962 for predicting the vibration and acoustic response of multiply connected reverberant subsystems within the framework of statistical energy analysis (SEA)."

  utter_answer_SEA_framework:
    - text: "Statistical energy analysis (SEA) is a framework introduced by Lyon in 1962. Hill has laid the foundations for statistical power balance modeling of EM fields in reverberant, multi-modal domains within this framework."

  utter_answer_deterministic_models_vs_statistical_reduction:
    - text: "Deterministic models, while an alternative approach, do not reliably estimate the predicted EM field at a specific point and frequency without statistical reduction to account for uncertainties in the EM source field and parameters of the reverberant domain."

  utter_answer_modal_expansion_basis:
    - text: "Bremner has shown how a modal expansion basis for each reverberant EM field can be used to predict the first two statistical moments of the response - mean and variance - from the physical EM parameters of each subsystem. It involves selecting a suitable probability density function to predict both mean and maximum expected response in each domain."

  utter_answer_application_of_statistical_power_balance_approach:
    - text: "Hill's statistical power balance approach has been applied to a general network of reverberant electromagnetic subsystems, including modeling EM environments in connected cavities typical of a space launch vehicle payload fairing. Junqua's approach, applied in this context, yielded encouraging results for the statistical mean electric field in each subsystem, beneficial for space vehicle EMC design."

  utter_answer_Inverse_Gamma_distribution:
    - text: "Bremner recently proposed an Inverse Gamma distribution for the frequency variance of the field energy, offering advantages over the heuristic assumption of a Log Normal distribution. Treating Rayleigh statistics as conditional on this frequency variance results in a non-parametric PDF for the frequency-stirred electric field, valid for a wide range of cavity Q factors."

  utter_answer_E_field_PDF:
    - text: "The new E field PDF proposed by Bremner is calculated from the predictable mean and variance of the energy. It is shown to be valid for a wide range of cavity Q factors and offers a consistent manner of predicting the electric field at any discrete frequency within a given band, applicable to both under-moded and over-moded cavities." 
  utter_answer_energy_subsystem_in_SPB_modelling:
    - text: "In statistical power balance (SPB) modeling, an energy subsystem refers to a group of resonant modes with a locally unique reverberant energy level. Variations in reverberant energy levels among connected cavity fields occur due to differences in field excitations in each cavity or significant variations in cavity Q, often caused by localized loss mechanisms such as RF absorbing materials or aperture leakage."
  utter_answer_total_energy_in_cavity:
    - text: "The total energy of the reverberant field in a cavity with volume V is equal to the product of its energy density averaged over space, indicated by <>, and its volume. Alternatively, it can be expressed as E = ½(εE^2 + μH^2)V, where ε, μ, E, and H are, respectively, the permittivity, permeability, total electric, and total magnetic fields at any location in the cavity. E is the field magnitude at a location. E^2 and H^2 are mean-squared electric and magnetic fields which are related through Z, where Z is the characteristic impedance of the medium. The total energy E is constant with time, but energy oscillates between electric field energy and magnetic field energy over time. When considering only the electric field energy, E = ½(εE^2)V, we have the additional ½ factor due to time averaging. However, the total constant energy is more important in this context."
  utter_answer_average_modal_density:
    - text: "Hill has shown that the average electromagnetic modal density of an enclosed volume is relatively insensitive to geometric details and can be calculated at any given frequency from only the electromagnetic wave speed and the volume of the enclosure."
  utter_answer_power_balance_principle:
    - text: "For any cavity reverberant field, the power balance principle requires that the power input from an external source (e.g., antenna) must be balanced by the total power dissipated by all losses, where Q is the cavity Q factor (Δf is the corresponding damping loss factor)."
  utter_answer_statistical_power_balance_modeling:
    - text: "Previous work on statistical power balance modeling used δ as the quantity describing energy dissipation in each cavity reverberant field and coupling cross section to describe energy exchange between two reverberant fields between cavities i and j, where δ indicates an average over all angles Ω and polarizations of the field. In this model, Lyon's dimensionless loss factor notation is preferred, denoted by η for the damping loss factor of cavity i and κ for coupling loss factors between cavities i and j."
  utter_answer_power_balance_model:
    - text: "In the power balance model, each cavity's damping loss factor includes wall losses, absorption cross sections (surface absorption losses), and antenna loading losses (effective antenna losses). It's important to note that, contrary to Hill's power balance modeling of reverberation chambers, neither the open aperture loss nor any leakage loss are included in each cavity's damping loss factor. This omission is because energy exchange through any aperture is modeled explicitly by a coupling loss factor. The net energy exchange across any aperture or leak depends on the difference in modal energy levels of the reverberant wavefields on each side, which can only be defined by the energy equilibrium solution of the power balance matrix (Eq. Ref 7)."
  utter_answer_absorption_coefficient:
    - text: "The absorption coefficient is defined as the integral of the absorption cross section over the surface area of the material. It represents the fraction of incident electromagnetic energy absorbed by the material. The average damping loss factor due to absorption for a cavity, along with its corresponding Q factor, is defined in reference literature. The Reflection Loss for RF absorbing materials is typically measured and published by the manufacturer and stored as spectral data in the model's cavity damping database. Alternatively, the surface absorption of a specific surface area inside a cavity may be defined by the 'absorption section.' In practical applications, such as reverberant field cavities containing electronics, losses from absorption of constituent materials and losses due to printed circuit board traces terminating in matched impedances are accounted for. Complex materials and assemblies within the cavity, such as a spacecraft with an array of electronics, typically have losses quantified as an absorption cross section. Recent measurements by Flintoft et al for an ensemble of different printed circuit board architectures show that surface absorption losses are generally greater than 'effective antenna' losses."
  utter_answer_coupling_loss_factor:
    - text: "The coupling loss factor consists of the coupling through apertures. Unlike Lyon's statistical energy analysis (SEA) coupling loss factors, which are less common in electromagnetics, aperture cross section is more widely used to describe the power transmission characteristic of the aperture. The power transmission coefficient (PTC) is defined as the ratio of power incident on the aperture from a source wavefield with reverberant energy E_r to the power transmitted to free field (i.e., reverberant energy level E_t). For an aperture in an enclosure surface, the average PTC over steradians and over all polarities of incident wave is denoted. By definition, the corresponding transmission cross section of the aperture (with units of area) is simply the average PTC multiplied by the area of the aperture. The aperture coupling loss factor is defined as the power transmitted to free field in the receiving space (E_t) for a given reverberant energy level in the source field (E_r). Therefore, the coupling loss factor is always defined for free field conditions in the receiving field (E_t) because it is an influence coefficient in the power balance matrix. Coupling loss factors defined in this way satisfy the reciprocity relationship."
  utter_answer_layered_materials:
    - text: "In high-frequency electromagnetic field engineering, two-dimensional panels or sheets of layered materials can play important roles. The laminate may consist of multiple layers, each with quite different materials or constructions, including dielectric materials (e.g., RF absorber, insulator, air, etc.), solid conducting materials (e.g., metals), perforates and screens, and other periodic constructions (e.g., frequency-selective surfaces). Each layer is assumed to have a finite (non-zero) thickness that is small compared to the transverse length and width dimensions of the laminate panel, and not much thicker than the wavelength of electromagnetic propagation in each layer material. Under these conditions, laminated sheets reflect, transmit, and absorb incident electromagnetic waves from a reverberant cavity field, but do not themselves support any strong build-up of local reverberant energy. As a result, they are represented in the statistical power balance (SPB) model as cavity wall loss factors and/or as energy transmission coupling loss factor(s) between reverberant electric fields."
  utter_answer_transfer_matrix_method:
    - text: "The surface reflection coefficient of a multi-layer laminate, required to calculate the wall loss factor, and the transmission coefficient of a multi-layer laminate, required to calculate the coupling loss factor, can be calculated using the transfer matrix method. The reflection coefficient is calculated as a function of incident wave angle and for two orthogonal polarities – transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM). These results are then averaged to provide the following 'macro' properties for the multi-layer laminate: Reflection Loss and Insertion Loss. For reverberant EM field modeling, the required averaging may be application-specific, and the user should have the option to specify normal incidence, random incidence, or field incidence, as well as TE, TM, or both polarities."
  utter_answer_dielectric_material_properties:
    - text: "A dielectric material is defined by three properties: permittivity, permeability, and conductivity. These properties may be approximately constant or defined as complex functions of frequency."
  utter_answer_conductive_material_properties:
    - text: "A highly conductive material (e.g., metal) is defined by two properties: conductivity and permeability. Similar to dielectric materials, these properties may be approximately constant or defined as complex functions of frequency."
  utter_answer_stochastic_wave_mechanics:
    - text: "The definition of an electromagnetic (EM) field response as an energy level allows the use of stochastic wave mechanics to define the modal properties and response of arbitrarily complex cavity fields. Stochastic wave mechanics models are stochastic in the sense that a larger ensemble of resonant modes in a subsystem – and a larger number of statistically independent subsystems in a total system model – leads to a more reliable, converged result. In statistical models, a converged prediction is one in which the relative variance of uncertainty on the prediction approaches zero, meaning the standard deviation of the uncertainty is very small compared to the predicted mean. In the context of Statistical Power Balance (SPB), the modal parameters of complex cavity fields are considered to be a statistical ensemble due to inherent uncertainty in the 'as-built' dimensions, boundary conditions, etc., and uncertainty in the 'as-operated' mass distribution, material properties, damping, etc., in addition to any uncertainty associated with random loading. These uncertainties are significant in any dynamic system at higher frequencies, and studies have shown that the as-built variability (uncertainty) is significant above only the first 5-10 resonant modes."
  utter_answer_frequency_stirred_probability_distribution:
    - text: "It is clear from Figure 9 that there is a stronger variance with frequency than would be typical of an over-moded reverberation chamber. As a result, the 'frequency-stirred' probability distribution differs significantly from the exponential distribution (Chi-squared with 2 degrees of freedom) used in reverberation chambers. Following the work of Lyon and Langley, Bremner used an asymptotic statistical reduction of the modal expansion for electric field in a cavity to confirm that the Chi-squared distribution at a single frequency is conditional on the spatial mean electric field. From Bayesian statistics, the unconditional electric field Probability Density Function (PDF) at any spatial point and frequency (rad/s) can be defined from the product of the conditional Chi-square distribution and the marginal distribution of the spatial mean electric field. The mean field in each cavity is directly proportional to the total energy, where E_total is a component of the total electric field. The mean energy level for k multiply-connected cavities can be readily predicted from the statistical power balance matrix. The unconditional electric field PDF can therefore be written in terms of the marginal PDF of the field energy level. Weaver has derived a non-parametric relative variance formulation for the energy of a reverberant wave field based on modal overlap m of the cavity’s input Conductance, where L and N are respectively the number of receiver and source positions used to calculate cavity energy. Modal overlap is defined as the ratio of the modal damping bandwidth to the frequency spacing. The parameter K is the measure of the spatial variance of the cavity mode shapes, which asymptotes to a value close to 3. Langley & Cotoni have provided a matrix formulation for propagating this relative variance for any network of multiply connected reverberant fields."
  utter_answer_energy_probability_distribution:
    - text: "There is not wide agreement on the probability distribution of energy. Researchers have proposed various distributions including Gamma, Log-Normal, and Complex Wishart distributions. Bremner has shown that energy is proportional to the sum of mean-squared electric field levels over the enclosure volume, represented as a sum over N samples. Similar to the total mean-squared electric field being Chi Square distributed with 6 degrees of freedom, the energy should be Chi Square distributed with 6N degrees of freedom. Lyon’s original 1969 paper suggested a Gamma distribution, which has a k parameter to represent the 6N degrees of freedom. However, the Gamma distribution is not a good fit for under-moded fields. The Inverse Gamma distribution has been found to be more suitable, taking the form shown. On a log scale, the inverse gamma distribution is approximately symmetrically banded for all. The relative variance increases asymptotically above unity at small values."
  utter_answer_unconditional_electric_field_PDF:
    - text: "A closed form solution for the unconditional electric field Probability Density Function (PDF) is possible if the marginal energy PDF is assumed to be an Inverse Gamma distribution, which is integrable. In this case, the probability density function for electric field level at any spatial point is a new distribution, as shown in the equation provided. The parameters alpha and beta can be calculated from the mean energy and the frequency variance of the energy for each cavity electric field. The parameter alpha is defined by the relative variance of the mean squared electric field, which is equivalent to the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) relative variance of energy. And the parameter beta is defined by alpha and the power balance equation for mean energy."
  utter_answer_lossy_cavities:
    - text: "In lossy cavities, the reverberant field is attenuated by the absorber materials, so the direct field from the source antenna and aperture power inputs to the cavity reverberant field cannot be ignored. The direct field amplitude at any location depends on the distance from the source due to spherical spreading of the radiated power. A direct field is always present for each source driving a reverberant field, and the total field is the uncorrelated sum of the direct and reverberant fields. The direct field is calculated independently for each effective power input, which can usually be assumed to be statistically uncorrelated. Hill has shown that the total field will have a Rice distribution, as described in the equation provided. The measured spatial field distribution shown in [25] indicates that in the Bare condition, the reverberant field dominates the direct field, and the spatial gradient of the field is determined by statistical power balance with a Chi-squared Probability Density Function (PDF). When one-inch-thick RF absorbing foam is added to the cavity walls, the reverberant field is attenuated to less than the direct field, and the total measured field approaches the spatial distribution of an ideal direct field. The top of the cavity (z>150cm) is always reverberant since there is no RF foam on the walls above 150 cm, and the parabolic shape results in strong field reflection and scattering."
