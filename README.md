# RobustPhysics RASA project
 
For this RASA project, please install python 3.10 [https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/) (any version of python from 3.6 - 3.10 works, but for consistency it would be better for everyone to use 3.10). If you have a version of python later than 3.10 it is not compatible with RASA. 

Then run `pip install rasa`
